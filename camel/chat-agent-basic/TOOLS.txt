Consider ReadWrite operations
-----------------------------
Tools could be prefixed like:
 - ReadOperationV, ReadOperationW
 - WriteOperationX,WriteOperationY

Also, tools in Camel could be tagged with:
- read
- write
- readwrite

This would allow the Tools component to use the tags to select Read and/or Write operations.

An agent could have 2 entrypoints:
 - dry run mode: executes only read operations
 - real run mode: executes both read and write operations

The entrypoints could set flags used by the tools to know how to behave.
For example, dry run mode entrypoint could set a variable 'dry=true' used by Write operations to respond with mock data to simulate the run.
