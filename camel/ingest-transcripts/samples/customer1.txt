**Customer:** Hi there, I noticed an issue with my invoice from Wade, Scott and Glover. The total amount seems incorrect.

**Agent:** Hello! Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Could you please provide me with the invoice ID so I can look into it further? It’s Invoice no: 67095041, correct?

**Customer:** Yes, that's right.

**Agent:** Great, thank you for confirming. Let me review the details of your invoice and get back to you as soon as possible with a resolution. Could you tell me more about what seems incorrect? Is it the total amount or something else?
