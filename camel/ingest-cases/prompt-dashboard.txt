Please build for me an HTML page with title should "Admin Dashboard".
All the sources generated should live in a single HTML page.

The page connects via WebSocket to a local server.
The local server will push events to the page, similar to this:
{
	"id":"123456",
	"summary":"Client has been charged twice",
	"executionPlan":["Refund overcharge","send discount voucher"]
}

For each event received the page should display the information in a table, mapping each one of the event fields to a column in the table.
The table should include an additional column to accomodate in each row added two buttons the user can click.

Rows added to the table should include an Approve (green) and Discard button (red), side by side
Rows added to the table should alternate background colours with soft colors, for example white and grey

The table should use the full width of the screen.
Make the table pretty and the header with some soft background color.

The field executionPlan should be displayed as a list of bullet points.

When the buttons are clicked by the user, the row should be eliminated from the table, 
and the page should send an event to the server that includes the id of the row and the action taken by the user.
