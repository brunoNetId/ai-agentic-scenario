**Customer:** Hi, I received an invoice for $205.50 today and it seems incorrect. The total amount is higher than what I expected to pay based on my recent order.

**Agent:** Thank you for reaching out, Kelly. Could you please provide me with the invoice ID so that I can review your account details? This will help me look into this issue more efficiently.

**Customer:** Sure, the invoice number is 53737787 and it was issued on 12/08/2011.

**Agent:** Thank you for providing the invoice ID. I’ll take a closer look at your invoice to ensure everything is accurate. Can you tell me more about what seems incorrect or unexpected in the charges?

**Customer:** The total amount includes items that I did not order, specifically "Escape from the Carnival of Horrors." These were not part of my recent purchase.

**Agent:** Thank you for clarifying. I will review your invoice to verify if there was an error in processing or a mix-up with another customer's order. We’ll make sure everything is correct on our end.

**Customer:** Great, thank you. Please let me know when you have more information.
